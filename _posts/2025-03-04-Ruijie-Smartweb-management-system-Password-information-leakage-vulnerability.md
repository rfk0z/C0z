The guest account exists by default, and the account password is `guest/guest`



During the login process, I searched for admin's data and found that a file `/web/xml/webuser-auth.xml` was requested, and the response contained the base64 encryption of the admin password.

By decrypting, you can get the admin administrator's password and try to request it directly.
